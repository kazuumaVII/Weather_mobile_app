# Weather_mobile_app

## Introduction 🤔
This is my first project in react native. The goal was to create a weather application that looks like Apple's in addition to adding a cursor that will take into account the time of day to display weather information like on google.
I realized it in parallel with my final project of my school on my free time

I also had to use for the first time redux toolkit to manage the states of certain components as well as Firebase to be able to store and synchronize my data
