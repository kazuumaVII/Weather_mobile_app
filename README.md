## Introduction 🤔
This is my first project in react native. The goal was to create a weather application that looks like Apple's in addition to adding a cursor that will take into account the time of day to display weather information like on google.
I realized it in parallel with my final project of my school on my free time

I also had to use redux toolkit for the first time to manage my component states as well as Firebase to be able to store and sync my data
